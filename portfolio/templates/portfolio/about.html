      <p>This is a webiste that I made to, first of all, learn website development and, second, to showcase 
      my thoughts, hobbies, and story. I honestly haven't been doing a good job at keeping this up to date. 
      Feel free to bully me into updating this.

      You may be here because you asked me about my childhood or where I lived before now. Well, your answer is in the <a href="{% url 'move:all_moves' %}">Timeline</a>.

      I think that I am something of a writer–I try to be anyway–which is why I've included a blog. 
        I'll be writing short essays, thoughts, and maybe stories on what I hope will be a monthly basis. 
        Or not.

       Back in the day–in the days of Pakistan to Nepal–I read quite a bit. Though I have slacked considerably since then, I still like to keep record of the books I have read recently; so 
       any recent reads may end up here on the website as well.
