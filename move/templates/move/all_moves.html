            <p>The land of my birth: Germany. My parents, freshly married, moved to Germany
             after their wedding, and I came soon after.</p>
             <p>My younger sister was born a year and a half later.</p>
             <p>While studying in Germany, my father was given the oppurtunity
             to join an NGO and go to Afghanistan. The rest is history.</p>

            <p>Before going into Afghanistan, our family went to live in England
            for six months.</p>
            <p>This is where I started picking up English, while forgetting
            my German. </p>
            <p>I guess this is where my first language was decided.</p>

            <p>This is where I first went to school. I remember being so excited to go to
            kindergarten before my fifth birthday. </p>
            <p>I had amazing teachers and great friends. As a kindergartener, I remember
            looking up at the sixth graders and wondering when I would be like them. </p>
            <p>Quite a few interesting stories from this time. I don't remember everything,
            but I look back on Afghanistan with a tender heart.</p>

            <h5 class="text-center mb-3">Daejeon, Korea</h5>
            <p>After the incident in July 2007 with the Koreans and the Taliban,
            our family could no longer stay in Afghanistan. So, for a while, we lived in Korea.</p>
            <p>This is the first and last time I ever attended a Korean public school
            for first and second grade.</p>
            <p>My youngest sister was born at this time. She was a cute surprise baby. </p>

            <p>These are perhaps the happiest years of my life so far.</p>
            <p>Many people left as we came in, leaving only a handful of foreigners in the country.
            At its lowest point, there were only two families and two ladies in our city. School
            was a blast.
            </p>
            <p>But eventually our family had to leave as well. And since it looked
            like we wouldn't be settling down anytime soonâ€“-an accurate forecast--my sister and I
            started homeschooling.

            <p>Three months living at Fatih, Istanbul and a few days at a resort by the sea.</p>
            <p>Sounds nice, no? Hikes by the beach, walks through the Grand Bazaar, fresh fish.</p>
            <p>But also the time I started homeschooling in earnest. Not a walk in the park.
            Took a while to get used to.</p>

            <p>Our family stayed in Tajikistan for one year.</p>
            <p>Although there was an international
            school, we decided to continue homeschooling. Despite that, I was able
            to make friend there, a few of whom were homeschooled as well.</p>
            <p>Started learning Russian a few months before we left.
            I am only now able to introduce myself, but I do remember that Russian
            numbers are quite complicated.</p>

            <p>I lived in Nepal on an off for about four years.
            Never thought I'd be in Nepal, let alone live there, but life's full of surprises.</p>
            <p>We were in Kathmandu during the earthquake of April, 2015. It was a normal Saturday
            morning; my sisters and I were watching animal videos when the first earthquake hit.</p>
            <p>Overall, a very nice place to live. The sunsets are by far the
            most beautiful here. And if you ever visit, I would definitely recommend
            getting a cup of coffee.

            <p>Life back in Korea was a strange change of pace. This was the first time
            I felt at home in my 'home' country. Ironic, I know.</p>
            <p>I ordered my first delievery pizza when I was sixteen. You have no idea
            how accomplished I felt. It was truly a life-changing event.</p>

            <p>Finally after fifteen years, I have returned to the country of my birth,
            a place I hadn't dreamed of being in again. </p>
            <p>I completed my high school education attending a couple German language courses.
            The plan was then to enroll into a university here. That was the plan.</p>
            <p>Long story short, I found myself in an interesting crack in the system.
            Uncertainty, my ever-present, ever-faithful companion, yet accompanies me. </p>
            <p>I suppose I have much to learn from her still.</p>
